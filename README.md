# s22-team5-project

This project was coded in python and uses the OpenAI gym as an environment.
If you would like to run our demo follow these steps as listed:

1. [step 1]
2. [step 2]

If you would like to take our main code and run it elsewhere, make sure that you have at least python 3.5 installed on your computer and have gym installed using pip.  
For instructions on how to do that, check out [this link](https://gym.openai.com/docs/).  
Then check out the [vizdoom github](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom) and install vizdoom for OpenAI gym.
